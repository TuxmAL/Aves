# Aves

##An hexagonal board world where some entities move. 

It was an old project of mine to model some flocking entities and see how they move in a world. I had some little script in [Squeak][1] an open-source Smalltalk programming system, but, alas, I haven't found it again for a long time.

## Hexagonal grids
Some month ago I bumped into [Red Blob Games blog][2] and especially into his hexagonal grids tutorial ([theory][3] and [implementation][4]) it seemed to me the right time to make it alive.
I really loved to see that someone had already made a Ruby library to start with: [rhex][5] (v 2.0.5), so I feel an urge to transform my old project into a new one in Ruby.

## A gold mine to dig for!
Not only, but [Red Blob Games blog][2] was a real gold mine to dig for,algorithms for path finding, object avoidance etc. are so inspiring to me!

## Some annoying issues
So I hope I will do it again, even if, at the moment, [rmagick 4.0][7] has some [issues][8] with [Imagemagick][9] [v 7.0][10] :-(

Cheers.
